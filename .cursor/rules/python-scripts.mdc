For logging calls, use the built-in string formatting instead of f"".

Do not write code comments for trivial pieces of code. Only for large code blocks that are not easily understood. Remove existing code comments if they explain a trivial piece of code.

Create a stand-alone function for repetitive code.

Try to avoid lines longer than 88 characters whenever possible. YOu can use shorter variable names in this case.

Use type annotation for all function signatures and return values.

Do not add un-used imports.
